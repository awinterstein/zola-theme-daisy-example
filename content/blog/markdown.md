## Blockquotes

Blockquotes without citation can be created like that:

```markdown
> Here is the **text** of the quote. \
> And here is a second line.
```

> Here is the **text** of the quote. \

And a citation can be added this way:

```markdown
> So long, and thanks for all the fish. \
> ― <cite>Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy[^1]</cite>
```

With the target of the citation to be added where it is supposed to appear (e.g., on the bottom of this example page):

```markdown
[^1]: The message, that was left by the dolphins when they departed earth in the fourth book.
```
